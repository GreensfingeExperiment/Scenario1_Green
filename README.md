# ðŸ›’ Product Recommendation System â€“ Greensfinge Experiment

The project follows a simple architecture with a service and a test class for validating the recommendation logic. It is part of an experiment to demonstrate how energy-saving strategies can be integrated into Java applications using the **Greensfinge Framework**.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

The project follows a simple architecture with a service, entity and repository.

## âœ… Description

- `entity.Recommendation`: Contains the business entity class.
- `service.RecommendationService`: Contains the business logic to format a recommendation.
- `repository.RecommendationRepository`: Simulates a database to search the values.

The RecommendationService class can be "greenified" using `GreenFactory`, allowing its behavior to change based on energy-efficiency configurations.
## ðŸ§ª Unit Tests

The test class `RecommendationServiceTest` validates the behavior of the recommendation logic:

In this task, you will see something like this, and the goal is to make all tests pass successfully.
